Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Web Development Tasks repository. This README provides an overview of the tasks I worked on during my internship at CodSoft.

## Task 1: Personal Portfolio Website
For my initial task as a web development intern, I designed and developed a personal portfolio website. This portfolio is not only visually appealing but also responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. It includes the following sections:

- **Header**: Featuring an introduction and navigation links.
- **About Me**: Providing insights into my background, interests, and professional journey.
- **Skills**: Highlighting my technical skills and competencies.
- **Projects**: Showcasing a selection of web development projects I have worked on.
- **Resume**: Providing access to my professional resume.
- **Contact Info**: Offering a convenient means to get in touch with me.
- **Footer**: Including copyright details to protect the content.

This task has been an enriching learning experience, allowing me to apply fundamental web development principles and practices. I am grateful for the opportunity to create my own portfolio, and it serves as a solid foundation for future web development ventures.

## Task 2: Responsive Food Recipes Landing Page
In my second task, I was tasked with creating a responsive landing page for a food recipes website. This project demanded the application of responsive design techniques to ensure that the landing page performs optimally on diverse screen sizes.

## Task 3: Calculator with Essential Functions
For my third and final task, I developed a calculator application that incorporates fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

## Technologies Used

I am genuinely appreciative of the opportunity that CodSoft has provided me to serve as a web development intern. These tasks have allowed me to expand my skills, deepen my understanding of web development, and set the stage for future growth and collaboration in this dynamic field.
